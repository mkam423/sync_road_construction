Description: Program creates three subthreads in addition to having the main
		thread. The three threads control 2 producing queues and one
		consumer queue. Is prompting the user and awaiting for an input
		in order to end the program. The semaphore option is used over
		the other option of condition variables and it is cleaned up,
		or destroyed, at the end of the program. The program utilizes
		the queue library in order to create standard queues for cars.
		Queues take in string which, in this case, is the time string
		in which a particular car enters this traffic and is later used
		to specify arrival time later in the car.log. The flagperson
		file has an indent on the awaken time in order to allow for
		easier reading. The overall layout of the source code in p2.cpp
		contains comments in more ambiguous areas so to clarify what
		is being done in that particular section. Overall program is
		easy to follow and has instructions for user to follow.
